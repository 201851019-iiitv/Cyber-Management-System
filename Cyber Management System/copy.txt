As we know that both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the most widely used Internet protocols among which TCP is connection oriented âˆ’ once a connection is established, data can be sent bidirectional.
 UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. 
Multiple messages are sent as packets in chunks using UDP. 
Now on the basis of features of attributes we can distinguish between TCP and UDP.
